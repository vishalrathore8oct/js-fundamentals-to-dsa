# JavaScript Fundamentals to Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **JavaScript Fundamentals to Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! 🎯

This repository documents my complete journey of mastering **JavaScript fundamentals**, **logic building**, and eventually **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes problems and solutions related to:

* Conditionals
* Loops
* Number Systems
* Patterns
* Arrays
* Strings
* Data Structures
* Algorithms

This repo is my long-term learning project, tracking my progress from beginner to advanced problem solving.
